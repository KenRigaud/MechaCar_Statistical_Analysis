# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Challenge 15


## Summary (Deliverable 1)

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	
	-Vehicle length had the smallest amount of error and incredibly large t-value which suggests no statistical significance

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	
	-No, the linear regression implies a positive correlation which would be impossible if the slope was 0.


#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
	
	-Arguably no, there isn't enough data to suggest strong relationships with car metrics and their respective MPGs. I'd say we'd need a more robust sample size before we could use this as a model for prediction.
